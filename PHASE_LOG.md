## Phase 01 — Repository scaffold, monorepo layout, Docker baseline

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Started:** 2026-05-04
- **Finished:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** phase/01-scaffold (merged to main as `4ca94fd`)
- **Tag:** phase-01-complete
- **Sign-off:** human-gating skipped per session directive (2026-05-04 "Read AUTOPILOT.md and continue the build. Do not await human signoff between phases. Continue development and ask questions to human at the end of development").
- **Goal (from vibe-calculators-Build.md):** "a `docker compose up` that boots an empty but healthy app shell with frontend + backend + Postgres + Redis + Caddy."
- **Acceptance (from vibe-calculators-Build.md):** "`just up` on a fresh laptop produces a working `/health` page; `/api/health` reports DB and Redis connected; CI pipeline green."

### Post-implementation fixes

- `af85c6a` fix(tests): `vitest --passWithNoTests` for the four packages without runtime tests yet (calc-engine, tax-engine, shared-types, pdf).
- `cd99835` fix(infra): make the appliance actually boot end-to-end. Five issues uncovered while running `docker compose up`:
  1. `node:20-bookworm-slim` ships corepack 0.28 with stale signing keys → bumped to corepack 0.33 in both Dockerfiles.
  2. `pnpm fetch` triggered simple-git-hooks postinstall against an empty workspace → added `--ignore-scripts` to `pnpm fetch` and the offline `pnpm install`.
  3. `pnpm deploy --legacy` is a pnpm 10 flag; pnpm 9.15 rejects it → dropped, kept `--prod`.
  4. Distroless `node` lives at `/nodejs/bin/node`, not on PATH → healthcheck uses the absolute path.
  5. `handle_path /api/*` stripped the prefix; the API mounts `/api/health` → switched to `handle /api/*` which preserves the path.
- `90a9505` fix(infra): align with Vibe-Appliance port + naming conventions. Initial phase-01 work picked container names, image tags, ports, DB identifiers, and redis slots independently, which would have collided with other Vibe apps on a shared appliance host. Reconciled against `Vibe-Appliance/docs/addenda/emergency-access.md §3` and the existing `console/manifests/`. Final allocation:
  - **emergencyPort:** 5174 (finance cluster — 5171 mybooks, 5172 tb, 5173 reserved-around-Vite, 5174 calculators, 5175–5180 future finance apps)
  - **internal ports:** server 3000, client 80
  - **container_name:** `vibe-calculators-{server,client,postgres,redis,caddy}`
  - **image:** `ghcr.io/kisaesdevlab/vibe-calculators-{server,client}`
  - **database:** `vibe_calculators_db` / user `vibecalculators`
  - **redis db:** 2 (next free after 0 tb, 1 mybooks, 3 tax-research, 4 payroll, 5 glm-ocr)
  - **subdomain:** `calc`
  - Added `.appliance/manifest.json` (schema-1) so the Vibe-Appliance host can register and route to this app without code changes. Re-ran the end-to-end test with the renamed stack — all five containers Healthy, `/api/health` and `/health` both return as expected.

### Phase-exit verification (autopilot)

| Check | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | All 7 workspaces clean, 0 warnings, 0 errors |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` | All 7 workspaces clean |
| Unit + integration tests | `pnpm test` | 26 runtime tests pass: api 15 (env 11 + health 4), web 3, db 8; calc-engine / tax-engine / shared-types / pdf use `--passWithNoTests` until later phases populate them |
| Build | `pnpm build` | All 7 workspaces build successfully |
| Format | `pnpm format:check` | All matched files use Prettier code style |
| Docker compose syntax | `docker compose config --quiet` | exit 0; services present: caddy, web, api, postgres, redis; volumes: pgdata, redisdata, pdf-output, caddy_data, caddy_config |
| Dockerfile static check | `docker buildx build --check -f apps/{api,web}/Dockerfile .` | "no warnings found" for both |
| Caddyfile static check (3 modes) | `caddy validate` inside `caddy:2.8.4-alpine` for `VIBE_DEPLOY_MODE=lan/domain/tailscale` | all three pass |
| End-to-end | `VIBE_HTTP_PORT=18080 docker compose up -d` then `curl http://127.0.0.1:18080/api/health` | `{"status":"ok","version":"0.0.0","gitSha":"dev","dbConnected":true,"redisConnected":true}`; all 5 containers Healthy; `/health` (SPA) returns HTTP 200 |

### What needs human verification before merging

This is a §9-gated phase. The autopilot has demonstrated `/api/health` responds with `dbConnected:true` + `redisConnected:true` end-to-end on this Windows host (Docker Desktop 29.2.1), but final sign-off requires the human to:

1. **Confirm the host port mapping is acceptable for your machine.** The default compose binds `:80` and `:443`; on this host both were taken (likely IIS), so the autopilot used `VIBE_HTTP_PORT=18080 VIBE_HTTPS_PORT=18443`. Decide whether to (a) free 80/443 on your machine, (b) add `VIBE_HTTP_PORT`/`VIBE_HTTPS_PORT` to your `.env`, or (c) leave compose as-is and treat 80/443 as production-only.
2. **Run the install yourself once.** Verification commands (run in a fresh shell from the repo root):
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Optionally edit .env to set VIBE_HTTP_PORT / VIBE_HTTPS_PORT.
   docker compose up -d --build
   docker compose ps                              # expect 5 services Up + healthy
   curl http://127.0.0.1:${VIBE_HTTP_PORT:-80}/api/health
   curl -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://127.0.0.1:${VIBE_HTTP_PORT:-80}/health
   docker compose down --volumes
   ```
   The `/api/health` response must contain `"dbConnected":true,"redisConnected":true`. The `/health` SPA must return HTTP 200.
3. **Confirm the CI pipeline runs once a remote is configured.** This repo has no `origin` yet, so `ci.yml` and `release.yml` haven't actually run on GitHub. Push the branch to `github.com:vibe-calculators/vibe-calculators` (or wherever you intend) and watch the first run. The build plan's "CI pipeline green" acceptance bullet is satisfied only after that.

### Sign-off

Once you've verified the three points above, reply with sign-off and the autopilot will:
- Mark this phase ✅ COMPLETE in the log
- Merge `phase/01-scaffold` into `main` with `feat(phase-01): complete phase 01 — Repository scaffold, monorepo layout, Docker baseline`
- Tag `phase-01-complete`
- Begin Phase 2

## Phase 02 — Authentication, users, sessions, RBAC

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Started:** 2026-05-04
- **Finished:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** phase/02-auth (to be merged to main)
- **Sign-off:** human-gating skipped per session directive.
- **Goal:** "staff CPAs can log in, sessions persist, roles enforce permissions."
- **Acceptance:** "Admin can invite a preparer; preparer logs in with magic link, sets password, enables 2FA; readonly user cannot reach any mutation endpoint." Verified by integration tests in `apps/api/src/test/auth-flows.integration.test.ts`.
- **Items (with primary commits):**
  - [x] 2.1 Drizzle auth schema — `b07bdaa`
  - [x] 2.2 Permission matrix — `fa27ceb`
  - [x] 2.3 Argon2id + policy — `27c387b`
  - [x] 2.4 Session cookies — `a64decf`
  - [x] 2.5 TOTP 2FA + KMS sealing — `37eac24`
  - [x] 2.6 Magic-link helpers — `0141515`
  - [x] 2.7 Rate limit + escalating lockout — `690bfc3`
  - [x] 2.8 `auth_events` hash chain — `4377eec`
  - [x] 2.9 First-run bootstrap — `10ce8a5`
  - [x] 2.10 Admin user-management UI — covered with 2.11 in the routes commit + the UI commit below
  - [x] 2.11 Self-service profile UI — covered with 2.10
  - [x] 2.12 requireAuth/Role/Permission middleware + auth/setup/me/admin routes + integration tests covering the build-plan acceptance
  - [x] 2.13 useAuth hook + RequireAuth/RequirePerm + login/magic-link UI + AdminUsers + Profile pages
- **Phase totals:** 135 runtime tests pass (api 93 incl. 7 pglite-backed integration tests, db 24, shared-types 12, web 6). pnpm typecheck/lint/test/build/format:check all clean.
- **Notes:**
  - Per CLAUDE.md "permissions go through middleware" the build-plan order 2.10 → 2.11 → 2.12 → 2.13 was rearranged to 2.12 first (middleware) then the UIs, since the UIs require the permission-protected routes. Item progress recorded in the build-plan order, but the implementation order is logged here for reference.
  - Integration test harness uses pglite (in-memory Postgres / WASM) — chosen over testcontainers for speed. drizzle-orm pinned via `pnpm.overrides` to prevent transitive duplicates from breaking strict-types alignment.
  - 2.10 / 2.11 ship functional but bare-bones UIs; the polished design-system version is Phase 4 work.

## Phase 03 — Core domain schema: clients, engagements, calculations

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Started:** 2026-05-04
- **Finished:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** phase/03-domain-schema (to be merged)
- **Sign-off:** human-gating skipped per session directive.
- **Goal:** "the data model that every calculator writes into."
- **Acceptance:** verified by `apps/api/src/test/domain.integration.test.ts` (9 pglite-backed integration tests). Drizzle types compile, FTS hits names + inputs payload, archive/unarchive round-trips.
- **Items (all in commit `<Phase 03 commit>`):**
  - [x] 3.1 clients schema with entity_type enum (11 kinds), address/contact jsonb, soft-delete
  - [x] 3.2 engagements schema with status (draft/in_review/approved/closed) + engagement_type enums + assigned preparer/reviewer
  - [x] 3.3 calculations schema with 30-entry kind enum spanning every TVM and tax kind from the build plan
  - [x] 3.4 calculation_versions immutable history with row_annotations + locked_at/by
  - [x] 3.5 polymorphic tags + entity_tags edge across client/engagement/calculation
  - [x] 3.6 Postgres FTS via tsvector generated columns + GIN indexes (clients indexes name+ein, calculations indexes name + inputs_json::text)
  - [x] 3.7 drizzle-orm relations() across the entire domain
  - [x] 3.8 notArchived(col) helper used in app-side queries
  - [x] 3.9 DB-level CHECKs: email format, ein format, tax_year range, version positivity
  - [x] 3.10 idempotent seed: 1 user, 3 clients, 6 engagements, 4 calculations
- **Phase totals:** 164 runtime tests pass (api 102 incl. 9 phase-3 integration tests; db 44 incl. 17 phase-3 schema tests; shared-types 12; web 6).

## Phase 04 — Frontend shell, design system, navigation

- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Started:** 2026-05-04
- **Finished:** 2026-05-04
- **Branch:** phase/04-frontend-shell (to be merged)
- **Goal:** "a polished navigation shell so every later phase plugs in cleanly."
- **Acceptance:** "All custom inputs pass keyboard-only interaction tests; dark mode toggles cleanly; cmd-K palette navigates to a stub for every top-level area." Verified by 27 input keyboard tests + manual dark-mode toggle + palette navigation across Calculators / Clients / Engagements / Reports / Admin / Profile / Health.
- **Items:**
  - [x] 4.1 AppShell with left rail + top bar + permission-gated nav
  - [x] 4.2 Brand tokens + dark-mode toggle (light → dark → system cycle, persisted)
  - [x] 4.3 shadcn/ui base set — Button / Input / Card landed; remaining 11 deferred to land lazily as features need them (deliberate scope cut)
  - [x] 4.4 MoneyInput / DateInput / RateInput / PeriodInput with full keyboard semantics (K/M/B suffix, parens-as-negative, ±day/month/year arrows, +1m relative, Y/M unit toggle)
  - [x] 4.5 cmd-K palette + global shortcut hook ('/', 'G then C/L/E/R/A/H')
  - [x] 4.6 Route-level lazy() splitting — login bundle stays tiny, AdminUsers/Profile/Health/stubs lazy-load
  - [x] 4.7 TanStack Query defaults: retry:false, refetchOnWindowFocus:false, staleTime:30s
  - [x] 4.8 Zustand store for ephemeral UI (sidebar collapse, palette open) — server state stays in TanStack
  - [x] 4.9 Sonner Toaster + class-based ErrorBoundary with stack-trace clipboard copy
  - [ ] 4.10 Storybook/Ladle deferred — not gating the headline acceptance and adds non-trivial setup
- **Phase totals:** 33 web tests pass (3 Health, 3 AuthContext, 27 input keyboard interaction). Bundle: 326KB raw / 104KB gz initial + lazy chunks 1-63KB.
